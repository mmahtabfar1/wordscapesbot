# wordscapesbot
A bot to cheat on the mobile game "wordscapes" written in Python.

I wrote this bot as a educational project over the summer to help me learn programming.

### Requirements
Python3 (it won't run in python2)
A suitable dictionary of a bunch of lowercase words. (the larger the better)
The wordlist that I use is included in the repository.

### Usage
Run the program using something like this:
```
$ python wordscapesbot.py
```
Enter the string of characters you want to have unscrambled and viola!
just sit back and watch the program do its thing.
